# RATP Agent Game

You, the red capsule, are a RATP agent—the French public company that operates most public transport in Paris and its suburbs. Travelers (yellow capsules) pass through two turnstiles from one side of the station to the other. Some cheat by jumping over a turnstile instead of going through normally. Your goal is to catch these fare dodgers. To do so, you must right-click on them to stop them. Be careful: checks take time, so make sure you only check cheaters and not passengers who are following the rules.
